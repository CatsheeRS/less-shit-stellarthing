# stellarthing

a game about space things

made in a custom engine made with c++ and raylib

## how to run????????????

### linux

first you need to install all of the gcc stuff and the raylib dependencies (look it up)

then run this:
```sh
cd build
./premake gmake2
cd ..
make
```

alternatively you can simply press f5 in vscode

### windows

first you need to install raylib (look it up)

then if you're using visual studio:

1. run `build-VisualStudio2022.bat`
2. open the generated .sln file

if you're using vscode you can just open this folder and press f5

NOTE: i don't use windows, i have no idea if this works
